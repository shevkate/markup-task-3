            WOMAN (just off to drive a 4-ton motor lorry): "Now that we've exchanged
            jobs and your vote will be used to protect my interests in the Home, don't
            you think had better give me a vote too, in order to protect your
            interests in the Labour market?"

            <h4>
                The Outlook
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Home Office authorities have for some days had under consideration
                the speech delivered by Mrs Pankhurst at Cardiff on Wednesday, the night
                following the bomb outrage. In this speech Mrs Pankhurst recalled that,
                when the Franchise Bill was withdrawn, "I told them that I was prepared
                to accept responsibility for all acts to which women felt themselves driven."
                She is reported as saying: "I have incited; I have conspired; and I say
                this - that the authorities need not look for the women who have done what
                they did last night, I accept responsibility for it. If tomorrow I am
                arrested for what happened and sent to penal servitude, I shall prove
                in my own person that the punishment cannot be carried out. If they send
                me for 5 years, 10 years, or 20 years, I shall not stay. I shall at once
                hunger strike. If they torture me with force-feeding, that cannot last
                very long; they cannot keep me alive very long; and they will have to
                let me die or let me go. If I drop out of the fight hundreds will take
                my place."
